# Reverse-Eng-Task
Reverse engineer the subscription plan change or cancel subscription workflow for a video
streaming service you subscribe/pay for. If you donâ€™t subscribe to a streaming service, do a
different subscription that you have for any service.
Use browser DevTools or a proxy to identify the exact API request needed to change or cancel
your plan. Collect cookies or other session info required to perform the api request,
authenticated.
Write a script that performs this action automatically - your script must be deployable, clear, and
show how authentication is handled. You need to prove that it works outside your specific
environment - leverage a proxy or a vpn to prove that your code works outside of your
environment.
Record a Loom video showing how you found the request, how the API works, and a live demo
of your script.
Submit the Loom link, your code in a public GitHub repo.
